# Literature Style Transfer

## What

What will a sentence look like if it is written by different writers? Interesting? This repo is aiming to achieve style transfer across different writers (currently only chinese writers because I am more familiar with chinese literature).

## How

Deep learning: Bert/Transformer, PyTorch, AllenNLP. Methods similar to StarGAN, CycleGAN, etc..

## Now

I am currently working on a classifier to classify text from two authors --- 莫言 and 张爱玲. Next I will train a style transfer between the two authors. After that, I will add more authors.
